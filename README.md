# SOLID Principles

A couple of examples in Java illustrating **SOLID** Principles.

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class should have only one single purpose.
- **Open Closed**: Classes should be open for extension closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution**: Each subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
- **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do.
- **Dependency Injection**: Components should depend on abstractions and not concretions.
